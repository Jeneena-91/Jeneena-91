ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jeneena, a professional data analyst with experience on more than 13 technical projects. My skills include business analytics, data visualization and storytelling, Python, SQL and ML. As an individual with a deep passion for both science and technology, I initially found myself drawn to the academic world, where I spent over six years mentoring students and analyzing performance data. But through this journey, I began to recognize an evolving interest that went beyond teaching: a fascination with working with data and unlocking its potential to solve real-world challenges. This unexpected discovery sparked an insatiable curiosity that led me down a new, exciting path.

After earning my master's degree in Power Electronics and Power Systems, I spent several years as an Assistant Professor in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, where I blended my love for teaching with data-driven research. My role required me to analyze complex datasets, design predictive models, and use data to improve both student outcomes and academic processes. My ability to transform raw data into actionable insights helped increase student pass rates and optimize course performance tracking. But it was through this lens of education that I began to see how powerful data could be in driving organizational growth and operational efficiency.

Realizing the growing demand for data specialists across industries, I decided to pivot my career toward data science. While pursuing a second degree was not feasible at that time, I sought out the TripleTen Data Scientist Program. This immersive, hands-on bootcamp allowed me to dive deep into the world of Python, SQL, machine learning, and data visualization. Over the course of the 10-month program, I worked on numerous real-world projects.

Armed with a solid foundation in data science and an extensive technical portfolioâ€”featuring over 13 projectsâ€”Iâ€™m eager to apply my skills in a new role that bridges data analytics with industry-specific needs.

I also stay engaged in the data science community by participating in events such as those organized by Women in Data Science. These events keep me inspired and give me opportunities to network and collaborate with like-minded professionals.

- âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not immersed in data, I enjoy the beautiful hiking trails of North Carolina. If you share a similar liking, let's connect!
